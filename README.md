# Turtle-Graphics-Hirst-Painting-day18
Day 18 project of creating a Damien Hirst style dot painting using colorgram and Turtle Graphics in python.

I have used an image of a mountain from which 100 random colors were generated using the colorgram package. 

Then using Turtle Graphics a Damien Hirst style dot image is created with these random colors.

You can run this program on replit (online) here
